## Project Overview
This project solves four real-world problems using different algorithmic strategies:
1. **Scheduling TV Commercials (Greedy — Job Sequencing)**  
2. **Maximizing Profit with Limited Budget (Dynamic Programming — 0/1 Knapsack)**  
3. **Sudoku Solver (Backtracking)**  
4. **Password Cracking (Brute-Force)**

All experiments are implemented in Python and tested in **Google Colab**. The notebook contains code, profiling, plots, and analysis.
